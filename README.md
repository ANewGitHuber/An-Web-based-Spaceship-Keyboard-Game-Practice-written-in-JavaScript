Click on one particular keyboard cell to select, then press "A"(Asteroid), "M"(Mine), "R"(Robotic Spaceship), "U"(Your Spaceship) to place the item you want in the keyboard. There is no limit in the number of asteroids, mines or robotic spaceship, but you should only have one user spaceship to control. When all is ready, press "End Setup" on the right-top corner to start the game!

You need to control your own spaceship to activate mines and defeat all robotic spaceships (Abbrev. as robot below) to win. Move your spaceship to the mines to activate them. Activated mines will change their form and become your friend to defeat robots. Robots will be destroyed if they crash to the mines your activated. But pay attention: robotic spaceships tend to eat those unactivated mines and hunt your spaceship. If your spaceship get caught by a robot, your spaceship will be destroyed.

WIN - defeat all robots and survive
LOSE - being defeated by robots
DRAW - other circumstances

Have Fun!
